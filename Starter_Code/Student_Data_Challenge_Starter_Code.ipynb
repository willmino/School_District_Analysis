    "##Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##Purpose\n",
    "# - The purpose of this analysis was to help Maria, a chief Data scientist, with analyzing student standardized\n",
    "# test data and presenting the findings and key insights to the county district. The takeaways from the analysis\n",
    "#will help key make key decisions for schools within this district.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - To help Maria, I read the standardized test data from csv format into jupyter notbook in a pandas dataframe\n",
    "# format. We cleaned the data by looking for both missing values and duplicated information and then eliminated\n",
    "# them. We analyzed the data by summarizing high level data statistics (such as min, max, mean, and sums of\n",
    "# particular datasets) and drilled down into the data to identify subsets of interest. Finally, we made \n",
    "# comparisons between subsets of interest to uncover some key insights pertaining to standardized testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Before beginning the analysis, we loaded the csv file into the pandas dataframe in Jupyter Notebook. \n",
    "# This was accomplished by:\n",
    "\n",
    "#`full_student_data = os.path.join('../Resources/new_full_student_data.csv')`\n",
    "\n",
    "#student_df = pd.read_csv(full_student_data)`\n",
    "\n",
    "#student_df.head()`\n",
    "\n",
    "# - The line of code listed above allowed us to check if the data was successfully imported into a dataframe.\n",
    "# -We cleaned the data by looking for the total number of rows per column that had missing data: \n",
    "# `student_df.isna().sum()`. This output showed that there was missing data for rows in the columns \n",
    "# `student_df[\"reading_score\"] and student_df[\"math_score\"]`. \n",
    "# So, we used the function `student_df = student_df.dropna()` to eliminate this missing data. \n",
    "# The same process was repeated for finding duplicated data. To do this, we used `.duplicated.sum()` and \n",
    "# `.drop_duplicates()` instead. Running the`.sum()` function was performed after eliminating the data and we \n",
    "# verified that there was a value of zero for missing data and dulicates in all of the dataframe columns.\n",
    " \n",
    "# - After cleaning the data, we were able to begin our analysis. We started by viewing a high level statistical\n",
    "# summary of all data in the dataframe using the code: `student_df.describe()`. We could use the mean values\n",
    "# in the columns for \"reading_Score\", \"math_score\", and \"school_budget\" to begin formulating what parts of the \n",
    "# data we should drill down into. First we found that the average reading score of all 9th graders was 69.2. \n",
    "# We found that the lowest reading score out of any student in the district was from 10th grader Matthew Thomas,\n",
    "# whose reading score was 10.5. I performed an additional analysis to observe the average reading scores of all\n",
    "# 10th graders at Dixon High School. The average reading score of 10th graders at this high school was 67.8 \n",
    "# which was considerably lower than the average reading score of all 9th graders. This could imply something \n",
    "#about the quality of reading education at Dixon High Scool. Furthermore, after drilling down into the dataframe\n",
    "# specifically for the 11th and 12th grade student reading scores, the average reading score for all of these\n",
    "# students was higher than any previously observed reading score at 74.9. This value further proves a point\n",
    "# that Dixon High School may want to evaluate its reading education platform. This figure for 11th and 12th\n",
    "# grade average student reading score was also higher than the average reading score of all 9th graders which\n",
    "# had an average reading score value of 69.2. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "# - One additional step of the analysis I wanted to perform was to group the student_df dataframe by \n",
    "# \"school_name\" and \"school_type\". Then, I took the mean of these values and sorted them in descending order. \n",
    "# The resulting dataframe was displayed as below.\n",

    "# school types, reading scores, math scores, and school budgets. It appeared that the values listed in the \n",
    "# \"reading_score\" column were pretty similar between Charter schools and Public schools. When you compare this \n",
    "# table with the dataframe output below, we can observe the mean value for reading scores is marginally \n",
    "# different comparing 72.45 at Charter Schools to 72.28 at Public Schools. Since the reading scores were so \n",
    "# similar, it was not too interesting of a dataset to drill down into. However, there was a difference in the \n",
    "# math scores at Charter schools compared to Public schools and I wanted to confirm why that might be. The \n",
    "# average math score at Charter schools was 66.76 and the average math score at Public schools was 62.95. \n",
    "# Charter schools most likely had a higher average math score because these schools receive funding that is \n",
    "# distinct from the public state school system. Charter schools are exempt from the rules of the public school\n",
    "# system and thus their success is more dependent upon student performance. We can see here that the Charter \n",
    "# schools have a higher average math score and that this could be the output that is required for these schools\n",
    "# to receive the level of funding they need. Public schools do receive more funding but they most likely need\n",

    "# the student math score by grade does not really have an influence on the total average math score. Even \n",
    "# though grade 12 math scores at Charter schools are the lowest, Charter schools still have a higher math score \n",

    "\n",
    "# - We found that Dixon high school had one of the lowest 10th grade reading scores in the district. The \n",
    "# reading scores for this school's 10th graders was lower than the reading score which was specifically for all \n",
    "# 9th graders and also lower than the reading score specifically for all combined 11th and 12th graders. This \n",
    "# was also accompanied by the lowest reading score in the entire district coming from a 10th grade student at \n",
    "# Dixon High School. We suggested to Maria that Dixon High School should re-evaluate the curriculum for its \n",
